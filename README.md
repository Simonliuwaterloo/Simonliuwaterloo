Welcome to my GitHub page!ðŸ‘‹   
I am a third-year software engineering student at University of Waterloo. I have a passion for developing softwares. I am currently learning distributed systems.  
### My interests:
* Running ( My 5k pace is about 4:30 in km, working to beat 4:00 this term)
* Photography (I took the photo above at Niagara Falls)
* Rock 'n' Roll (Pink Floyd, Dire Straits), learning to play guitar myself
* Writing (working on my post-apocalyptic novel right now. World-building question for you: what is a possible cause for a non-recoverable power outage in North America?)
